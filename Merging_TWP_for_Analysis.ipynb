       "['\"A muscle builder. A fat burner. A sleep aid. An aphrodisiac. A natural \"\"high.\"\" Claims like those helped boost sales of gamma butyrolactone (GBL), a dietary supplement that the Food and Drug Administration asked manufacturers to recall last month because of at least 55 cases of serious illness, including users who suffered seizures, coma and respiratory arrest. At least one person has died after taking GBL, which the FDA considers a dangerous, unapproved drug. Sold over the Internet and in gyms and health food stores, products containing GBL gained popularity last year because the supplement produced the same effects as gamma hydroxybutyrate or GHB, a banned chemical cousin. Never an approved drug, GHB had attracted bodybuilders and wrestlers as an alternative to steroids for \"\"bulking up\"\" muscles, as well as recreational users intrigued by its odd combination of sedative and stimulatory effects on the brain. It also became notorious as a date rape drug. GHB\\'s production and sale were banned in 1991 after it was linked to numerous cases of serious illness and some deaths. Last summer, cases like those associated with GHB--comas, unexplained seizures, people with dangerously slow heartbeats or breathing--began showing up in GBL users, said Mary Palmer, a toxicologist working on a large study of illness and poisoning in dietary supplement users. There are no reliable figures on how many people have taken GBL, whose primary use is as a solvent in products such as floor stripper, paint thinner and nail polish remover. It goes by various chemical names and is an ingredient in several dietary supplement products. (See box.) The similar symptom profile is easy to explain: GBL is chemically converted by the body into GHB, the banned drug. \"\"The seemingly less worrisome supplement becomes converted into something that\\'s very worrisome,\"\" said Gary I. Wadler, an associate professor of Clinical Medicine at New York University School of Medicine and lead author of a textbook on drugs and the athlete. Wadler said the recent popularity of GBL resembles the situation with androstenedione, another over-the-counter supplement taken by some athletes that the body converts into testosterone, a prescription hormone. In both cases, he noted, the laxity of the law regulating dietary supplements allows people easy access to substances that can act like powerful drugs and that may pose serious risks to their health. When the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act was passed in 1994, reducing the FDA\\'s authority to regulate supplements, \"\"I don\\'t think anybody envisioned this scenario as it\\'s playing out,\"\" Wadler said. \"\"It is time to revisit that act.\"\" The banned GHB has a dual action on the brain. Like cocaine, it stimulates nerve cells that respond to the chemical messenger dopamine, producing an excitatory effect. Like heroin, it activates natural opium-like substances within the brain, causing sedation. Taking GHB \"\"is sort of like taking heroin and cocaine at the same time,\"\" Wadler said. The result can be a perplexing set of symptoms. Palmer recalled the case of a New York topless dancer. \"\"She did her dance, got offstage and she dropped. She came into the emergency room in a coma.\"\" Doctors inserted a breathing tube. They discovered that her heart rate was 50--alarmingly slow. Then she developed an irregular heartbeat. When she woke up, she admitted that she had taken GHB. GBL apparently can produce a similar spectrum of effects. Arizona doctors reported the case last September of a 36-year-old man who was stopped for driving erratically and was found to be sweating, vomiting and lethargic. He acted drunk but tests for alcohol and illicit drugs were negative. He recovered within an hour and reported that he had taken two ounces of RenewTrient, a GBL-containing product. GBL never should have been marketed as a dietary supplement because it was a new ingredient that had been clearly shown to have dangerous effects in human and animal studies, said Annette Dickinson, vice president for scientific and regulatory affairs of the Council for Responsible Nutrition (CRN), a trade association representing about 100 supplement manufacturers. She noted that the companies selling GBL do not belong to her organization. \"\"We don\\'t see how anyone could reasonably conclude that it would be safe at the kind of levels that were recommended\"\" on product labels, she said. Last Friday, the FDA announced that three manufacturers of GBL- containing supplements--G.H. Distributors Inc., Trimfast Group Inc. and Conan Corp./Castlewood Nutritional Systems--had agreed to the voluntary recall. The agency has sent letters to four other companies, warning of possible legal action against their products if they do not cooperate. Warning letters were sent to Alpha Earth Inc., Miracle Marketing Distributors and RenewTrient Research (all of Florida) and Advanced Athletic Nutrition of Roseville, Calif. Sanjay Sabnani, a spokesman for Trimfast, said the company is in the process of rounding up its Revivarant products from distributors. \"\"We have never received any complaints from customers or health authorities,\"\" he said. Paul A. Cotton, a sports nutritionist and the head wrestling coach at Howard University, said GBL is \"\"mildly popular,\"\" in the wrestling community, whose athletes often are attracted to substances that they believe will give them a competitive edge. He said he had counseled athletes who had tried GBL but hadn\\'t encountered any cases of illness. They\\'re \"\"a little bit secretive about what they\\'re taking,\"\" he added. Cotton said he warns his athletes that purity and manufacturing standards for dietary supplements have not been set by the government. \"\"I kind of equate it to buying street drugs,\"\" he said. However, he predicted that news of the government recall of GBL may trigger a flurry of last-minute orders for the products over the Internet. \"\"Those individuals in the gymnasium . . . always say, \\'If it wasn\\'t working, they wouldn\\'t take it off the market,\\' \"\" he said. GBL AT A GLANCE Name: Gamma butyrolactone, often called GBL. The supplement is commonly sold under the names of Renewtrient, Revivarant or Revivarant G, Blue Nitro or Blue Nitro Vitality, GH Revitalizer, Gamma G, Insom-X and Remforce. GBL may be an ingredient in additional products. It is also known by its chemical names 2(3h)-furanone dihydro, butyrolactone, 4-butyrolactone, dihydro-2(3H)-furanone, 4- butanolide, 2(3H)-furanone dihydro, tetrahydro-2-furanone and butyrolactone gamma. Marketing: Sold over the Internet, in some health food stores and some gyms and fitness centers. It comes in a liquid and powder form. Promoters claim GBL builds muscles, improves physical performance, promotes fat loss, enhances sex, reduces stress and induces sleep. Side Effects: Seizures, vomiting, slow breathing, slow heart rate, loss of conciousness. Reports of at least 55 adverse health effects have been reported to the Food and Drug Administration, including one death. Gamma butyrolactone is converted in the body to gamma hydroxybutyrate or GHB, which is a potent unapproved drug. To Report Problems: Call FDA\\'s MEDWATCH at 1-800-332-1088. The FDA advises all consumers to dispose of any supplies they have of GBL. Source: Food and Drug Administration Credit: Washington Post Staff Writer\"',\n",
       " '\"\"\"If you can\\'t pronounce it, it\\'s a chemical,\"\" said the talk-show guest, surrounded by a pile of cans and boxes. \"\"And I don\\'t know how many people want to be eating chemicals.\"\" I was dumbstruck. The presumed expert, a physician, was urging viewers to stay away from anything that contained \"\"chemicals.\"\" That would be the ultimate diet plan. Everything in the world is made of chemicals, the building blocks of all matter. Unfortunately, the word \"\"chemical\"\" has unjustifiably become synonymous with \"\"toxin\"\" and \"\"poison.\"\" Never mind that hundreds of perfectly \"\"natural\"\" substances produced organically by bacteria, mushrooms, shellfish and dozens more are lethal. For many people, one unfamiliar compound listed on a food package can force a gulp. How pervasive are misunderstandings? I asked students in my introductory chemistry class to examine labels on some of their favorite junk foods and identify those that made them uneasy. They rose to the challenge with questions aplenty. Why did so many of their favorite cookies have partially hydrogenated fats? Were manufacturers too cheap to give them full hydrogenation? Wasn\\'t titanium dioxide an ingredient in Liquid Paper? And, if so, what was it doing in a packaged donut? Were diglycerides twice as good as monoglycerides? Was there really car wax on their candy? How come ice cream had xanthan gum if you weren\\'t meant to chew it? And much more. Clearly, confusion is pervasive. Additives are not randomly added by callous processors to foods in order to mystify consumers. They perform specific functions from the essential to the frivolous. An exhaustive discussion is beyond our scope. But here are a few representative examples. PRESERVATIVES Unfortunately, bacteria and fungi often like to dine on the same kinds of meals we enjoy. Accordingly, we have developed a wide array of preservatives. Mold inhibitors are one of the most important classes, and sodium or calcium propionate are among the most widely used. They effectively inhibit growth of molds and bacteria but leave yeasts alone. Therefore, they are ideal for use in baked products. They also are nothing to fear. We are constantly exposed to naturally occurring propionates, byproducts of the metabolism of fat, in much greater doses. (Pion is the Greek word for fat.) Swiss cheese, for example, contains a much higher level of natural propionates than is found in any food in which it appears as \"\"artificial preservative.\"\" Our bodies produce propionates from the fat we eat, and the compounds are found in sweat secretions. Oxygen is another enemy of food. Rancidity in fatty foods is the result of the breakdown of fats into odiferous smaller molecules in the presence of oxygen. These compounds are not themselves dangerous but may signal spoilage. Fats that contain carbon-carbon double bonds in their molecular structure, called unsaturated fats {see below}, are especially prone to oxidation. Several additives slow this process by reacting with intermediate, highly reactive \"\"free radicals\"\" -- molecular assemblies with an unpaired electron -- that play an essential role in the chain reaction that produces rancidity. BHT (butylated hydroxytoluene), BHA (butylated hydroxyanisole) and propyl gallate are widely used in potato chips, vegetable oil, shortening, candy and a variety of convenience foods. BHT often is added to cereal packaging; from there, it migrates into the cereal \"\"to help maintain freshness.\"\" Studies attempting to determine whether hazards are associated with these antioxidants have been inconclusive. HYDROGENATED FATS For many youngsters, licking the creamy filling (basically, sweetened fat) from a sandwich cookie is one of life\\'s little pleasures. But too many such delights can send our cholesterol levels into orbit. That\\'s the way the cookie crumbles. And that\\'s part of the problem. When such cookies were conceived, it became apparent that, to achieve the proper degree of crumbliness, the dough had to be loaded with saturated fat. The creamy consistency of the filling also required saturated fat {see illustration}. But eventually, research showed that saturated fats clogged coronary arteries and other blood vessels. Consumers began urging food processors to replace the offending fats with unsaturated vegetable oils. Lard, butter, palm oil and coconut oil, the major sources of saturated fats, were to be expunged from foods. Soon, labels loudly declared contents \"\"low in saturated fats,\"\" and hamburger emporiums proudly proclaimed that their french fries were fried in vegetable oil. Apparently, we could now relax and dine on fatty cookies and french fries as our blood gushed unimpeded through clean arteries. Well, not quite. The switch to vegetable oils was indeed made. But what remained unsaid was that many such oils had been chemically modified to render them more like saturated fat. An unsaturated vegetable oil can be solidified and made to behave more like a saturated fat by \"\"partially hydrogenating\"\" it. Treatment with hydrogen gas allows insertion of some hydrogen atoms into the molecule. Unfortunately, this not only makes the fat more saturated but also converts some of the unsaturated fat molecules into a slightly different, although still unsaturated, form. These so-called transfatty acids, which fall under the \"\"unsaturated\"\" umbrella for product-label purposes, have had the \"\"molecular kink\"\" taken out of them. Their long, straight chains can now cluster, behaving just like the infamous saturated fats. Unfortunately, they also behave somewhat like saturated fats in the body. So, in a sense, we are out of the frying pan and into the fire. EMULSIFIERS Food producers often need to combine materials that normally do not mix. The oil-and-water mixture known as peanut butter is a classic example. Without chemical intervention, an oily layer separates and floats on top, making for an unappetizing product. Emulsifiers, such as the popular monoglycerides or diglycerides, can prevent this tragedy. Their molecules have one end soluble in oil and the other soluble in water. When an emulsifier is added to an oil-water mixture, the oil- soluble ends of these molecules aggregate around fat molecules, forming submicroscopic clusters known as micelles {see illustration}. The water-soluble ends protrude from the micelle and anchor themselves in the surrounding water. The result: Fat is homogeneously dispersed. Numerous other emulsifiers exist, some with really strange names, such as carrageenan. Centuries ago, housewives in the little Irish town of Carragheen discovered it in seaweed and used it to thicken pudding. Chemically speaking, carrageenan is a polysaccharide, a giant molecule composed of various derivatives of the simple carbohydrate galactose. It reacts with milk protein while its water-soluble periphery binds to water molecules, anchoring the mass and setting up the gel texture characteristic of puddings. It is added to chocolate milk to keep the insoluble cocoa particles from settling out; in tomato juice, it maintains an even suspension of fine pulp. In low-calorie foods, carrageenan and other \"\"gums\"\" such as guar or xanthan, can replace the \"\"mouth feel\"\" of a food lost when sugar or oil is removed. Carrageenan also can act as a \"\"glue\"\" between fat and water. Fat molecules become dispersed throughout the inner structure of the polysaccharide while water binds to the outside, preventing separation. One of its most interesting uses is in ice cream, which assumes a grainy texture as it ages in the freezer. Each time the freezer door is opened, a small amount of ice cream melts and refreezes, forming ice crystals. But carrageenan or other gums trap the melted water into a gel structure and thus maintain the smooth texture. FLAVORS Natural and artificial flavors comprise the largest category of food additives, and it\\'s often hard to tell which is which. Want to give a little tart taste to a candy? Citric acid will do the job. This is the same substance that makes your mouth pucker when eating a lemon. Extraction of citric acid from lemons is possible but not economically viable. So it\\'s synthesized on an industrial scale by fermentation of crude sugar solutions. The result is chemically identical to natural citric acid but may be labeled \"\"artificial flavor.\"\" But artificial flavors are not necessarily copies of natural flavors. For example, 3-methyl-2-butenylethanoate is the flavor of Juicy Fruit gum. It is a true artificial flavor, concocted by food chemists looking for a unique taste. Perhaps the most interesting example of a flavor additive is one found by Hernando Cortes and his conquistadors when they arrived in Mexico in 1519. The Aztecs greeted him with a curious brown beverage called chocolatl, made from powdered cacao beans and ground corn. Cortes was especially interested in the little bits of a plant pod used to flavor the drink. This was tlixochitl, the Aztecs told him. The name did not exactly roll off the Spanish tongue, so Cortes renamed it vanilla, for \"\"little pod.\"\" Both vanilla and chocolatl were an instant hit in Europe. A few centuries later, the world was demanding more vanilla than the plants could produce, and 20th century chemistry came to the rescue. Analysis of vanilla extract showed that most of the flavor was due to one compound called vanillin, which could be synthesized in the laboratory from oil of cloves. Artificial vanilla flavoring was born, chemically identical to the natural substance, but less expensive. Today, vanillin is produced on a large scale from pulp and paper waste. Purists will claim that the artificial flavor is inferior, and in a sense they are right. The natural version contains several other compounds that modify the flavor. The artificial version is pure vanillin. But in this case, purity detracts from the taste. COLORS Perhaps the most controversial of all additives are food dyes. Some are beyond reproach, such as the carotenoids (chemical cousins to beta carotene, precursor of vitamin A) that are derived from the annatto plant and used to give processed cheese that familiar orange glow. But people tend to raise their eyebrows when confronted by the likes of tartrazine, Red No. 3, titanium dioxide or cochineal on a label. They may have reason for concern. The safety of Red No. 3 -- used extensively in candies, baked goods, maraschino cherries, drugs and cosmetics -- is being reevaluated. While most studies have shown no harm to test animals, a few have implied that male rats receiving a very high dose of the substance (4 percent of their total lifetime diet) had a higher incidence of thyroid tumors. This seems unlikely to have a practical relevance for humans. Titanium dioxide is a common pigment in white paints, and its ability to reflect light sometimes is used in various foods. Doughnuts, for example, may owe their shiny glaze to this compound. The body doesn\\'t absorb it. The most legitimate safety concerns appear to be about Yellow No. 5, or tartrazine. This colorant has been linked with adverse reactions in a few sensitive individuals generally aspirin intolerant, allergic or asthmatic. Symptoms may include hives, itching, runny nose and asthma. Although detailed studies have not shown a statistically significant number of such reactions, most authorities agree that, in rare cases, tartrazine sensitivity exists. Consequently, this dye is the only one that must be identified by name on food labels. Although tartrazine does not represent a major health risk to most people, curtailment of its use in some areas, such as in certain children\\'s asthma medications, clearly is appropriate. Even coloring agents in existence for hundreds of years may not be completely safe for everyone. Consider reddish cochineal, prepared from an extract of the dried bodies of the females of the insect species known as Coccus cacti. Cochineal, and its derivative carmine, are two of the oldest food dyes, dating to the Aztecs. Cortes introduced the extract to Europe in the 16th century, and it became extremely valuable until synthetic dyes were introduced in the mid- 1800s. At one point, half a million pounds of extract were shipped annually from Mexico to Spain -- an astounding amount, considering that about 70,000 hand-gathered insects are needed to produce a pound of cochineal. Today, cochineal insects still are raised on special cacti in Mexico and elsewhere to produce the carmine used in foods, drugs and cosmetics. A few allergic reactions, typically hives and itching, have been reported. In one account, an asthmatic reaction was triggered by just 1.3 milligrams of carmine in cherry yogurt; in another, a young boy reportedly experienced a shock-like reaction after eating a pink popsicle that contained carmine. A similar fate was suffered by a lady after drinking Campari colored with cochineal. She had become sensitized by using carmine-colored cosmetics and had, in fact, noted that her skin itched after she applied lipstick. Still, in comparison to the number of people consuming foods colored with cochineal, these reactions are extremely rare, far more rare than reactions to undyed foods such as peanuts, strawberries or milk. MISCELLANEOUS ADDITIVES How would you like to have a little shellac, some invertase or a substance called xylitol in your food? You\\'ve probably had them already, with no problem. Shellac is the resinous secretion of the female Indian \"\"lac\"\" bug. It spends its whole life attached to a tree, sucking juices and converting them into the familiar sticky substance. Shellac has long been used to provide a glossy protective coating on wood, for stiffening hats and making buttons. The first hair sprays had shellac as their main ingredient, and the first phonograph records were made of this material. Shellac is soft and flows when heated but becomes rigid at room temperature. In the food industry, where shellac has been used safely for decades, it often is referred to as \"\"confectioner\\'s glaze\"\" and can be used to give a protective, glossy coating to candies, jelly beans and ice cream cones. Since shellac is insoluble in water, it can form an impermeable layer and prevent the food product from drying out. Citrus fruits and avocados sometimes are treated with shellac for this reason. Another kind of protection against drying is on display every time you bite into a chocolate with a liquid center. You\\'re enjoying the work of invertase, an enzyme whose job is the breakdown of sucrose, ordinary table sugar usually derived from cane or beets. Sucrose is a \"\"disaccharide\"\" (two-sugar) compound, composed of two smaller molecules, glucose and fructose, chemically bound. An enzyme in the digestive tract normally breaks sucrose into glucose and fructose, which then are absorbed into the bloodstream. Fructose eventually is converted to glucose in the liver since glucose is the only form of carbohydrate that human cells use as an energy source. This same enzyme also is produced by certain yeasts that use sucrose as a food source, and chemical techniques can isolate it from the yeast. It has been given the name \"\"invertase.\"\" This unusual term refers to the interaction of certain types of molecules with light. Light can be described as a form of electromagnetic radiation made up of waves vibrating in all planes. When light is passed through a \"\"plane polarizing\"\" filter, only the waves vibrating in one plane emerge. This is how polarizing sunglasses filter sunlight. Certain compounds, when placed in the path of a beam of polarized light, rotate the plane of the light. If it moves to the right, the substance is referred to as dextrorotatory; if to the left, it is called levorotatory. Sucrose shifts light to the right, but a mixture of glucose and fructose rotates it to the left. Hence the term inversion. Invertase is part of the secret behind creamy chocolates. Another important fact is that glucose and fructose are more soluble in water than is their joint product, sucrose. So the idea, as developed by H.S. Paine, an American chemist, in 1924, is to make a paste of sucrose with a little water to which invertase has been added. There is not enough water to dissolve the sugar, and the fudge-like mass can be coated with melted chocolate. Over several weeks, the enzyme breaks the sucrose into glucose and fructose. Those molecules, being more water soluble, can dissolve in the small amount of water available. The result is a liquid-center chocolate! If desired, the original paste can even be molded around a maraschino cherry. Of course, the Streptococcus bacteria that live in our mouths just love sugar. When they metabolize it, they produce acids that eat away tooth enamel and cause cavities. They also love starches that they can break down to glucose and convert into acids. Moreover, sugar increases the caloric content of food -- a major problem in the world\\'s tubbiest society. Sugar substitutes have been introduced to allay some of those and other concerns about sugar. Sugarless gum, for example, usually is sweetened with xylitol or sorbitol. These molecules have the same approximate shape, and hence nearly the same chemical effect on the pores of taste buds, as does sugar. But they cannot be digested by bacteria in the mouth or gut. In moderate doses, they are harmless; but excessive amounts can, in some instances, produce loose stools. Xylitol has been shown to reduce tooth decay. This compound, made from the naturally occurring sugar xylose found in birch trees, corn cobs or peanut shells, may even fight childhood ear infections by preventing bacteria from sticking to the back of the mouth. Granted, all of this stuff may be a little hard to digest. Try it with a spoonful of beta-D-fructofuranosyl-alpha-D-glucopyranoside. Don\\'t worry. It\\'s just sugar! Joe Schwarcz is a professor of chemistry at McGill University and Vanier College in Montreal. Fat City Vertebrates store energy as fat in the form of \"\"triglycerides.\"\" Those are assemblies of three fatty acid strings, each of which binds to a molecule of glycerol, a common alcohol in the body. There are about 70 known fatty acids, the most common of which are shown at right, minus their acid ends. Fatty acid chains are composed of carbon and hydrogen atoms. A chain that contains as many hydrogen atoms as the carbon scaffolding can support is said to be \"\"saturated.\"\" That is the medically more worrisome type, chiefly found in animal fats and associated with clogging blood vessels. In \"\"unsaturated\"\" fats common in plant oils, one or more carbon atoms form double-bond linkages instead of binding to additional hydrogen atoms. The double-bond sites are chemically reactive, making the strand easier to change. Unsaturated fats are decidedly kinky at the position of the double bond, which means that they cannot be packed as closely as the straight saturated fats. Emulsion An emulsion is a liquid suspended in another liquid (above). Familiar examples include milk and butter. The suspension can be encouraged by the presence of substances called emulsifying agents, such as monoglycerides and diglycerides. Those are versions of the familiar triglyceride fat configuration that has lost one or two fatty acid chains. Having lost one or two chains, the glyceride now has one water- soluble end. Such emulsifiers cause formation of ball-shaped objects called micelles. A micelle forms when the fat-soluble ends of molecules are drawn to fat globules at the center of a sphere. This leaves the water- soluble ends protruding into the solution.

The product contains furanone, a chemical name for gamma butyrolactone.

       " '\"The Supreme Court ruled unanimously yesterday that trial judges have great discretion to decide what type of scientific testimony can be presented to juries, a decision that could have a significant impact in product liability cases around the country. Scientific experts have become ubiquitous in personal injury trials, with their testimony forming the basis of highly publicized complaints against manufacturers in breast implant, toxic waste and other liability lawsuits. For that reason, yesterday\\'s case had been closely followed by business and labor, scientists, and the medical and legal community. Expert testimony is intended to enlighten a jury about a difficult, complex subject, but judges increasingly worry that parties to a case can find an \"\"expert\"\" to testify to anything and that flawed or distorted research -- \"\"junk science\"\" -- can mislead jurors. The key question yesterday was how much deference an appeals court must give a trial judge\\'s decision to exclude or admit \"\"expert\"\" testimony. The answer: Quite a lot. Only if the trial judge \"\"abuses\"\" his or her discretion, that is, acts unreasonably or in a way totally unsupported by law, can an appeals judge reverse the decision on whether to admit expert testimony. The ruling clarifies a 1993 Supreme Court decision expanding trial judges\\' authority to decide whether testimony is sufficiently reliable and relevant for trial. In their decision yesterday, the justices emphasized that trial judges, acting as \"\"gatekeepers\"\" of scientific evidence, should examine not only the conclusions of an expert but also his or her methodology. The justices said it was appropriate in this case -- brought by a man claiming he got lung cancer after handling chemical PCBs -- for a trial judge to bar testimony focused partly on studies of mice. The studies involved infant mice that had developed cancer after being exposed to massive doses of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). But the lawsuit concerned a man whose alleged exposure had been far less than that in the animal study. \"\"The studies were so dissimilar to the facts presented in this litigation that it was not an abuse of discretion for the district court to have rejected the experts\\' reliance on them,\"\" Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist wrote for the court. Further, Rehnquist said, referring to other studies linking PCBs to lung cancer, a judge \"\"may conclude that there is simply too great an analytical gap between the data and the opinion offered.\"\" Yesterday\\'s case was brought by Robert K. Joiner, a longtime electrician for the Water and Light Department of Thomasville, Ga., who was diagnosed with lung cancer in 1991. Joiner said his work maintaining and repairing transformers exposed him to coolant fluid containing PCBs, furans and dioxins, which caused or promoted his cancer. (He acknowledged that the cancer might have been caused in part by his cigarette smoking.) Joiner sued General Electric and Westinghouse, which made the transformers, and Monsanto, which manufactured PCBs from 1935 to 1977. (Congress in 1978 banned the production and sale of PCBs, now considered hazardous to human health.) The manufacturers countered that there was no evidence that Joiner suffered significant exposure to PCBs or that whatever level of exposure he may have received brought on Joiner\\'s cancer. Joiner sought to offer statements from experts that showed PCBs cause and promote cancer. But a judge ruled for the manufacturers, saying the testimony from Joiner\\'s experts lacked sufficient reliability. The judge also said Joiner failed to show he had been exposed to furans and dioxins. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit reversed, applying a particularly stringent standard of review to the trial judge\\'s decision to exclude the expert testimony. In overturning the part of that ruling regarding the PCB evidence yesterday, the justices said the trial court\\'s actions did not rise to an \"\"abuse of discretion.\"\" Justice Stephen G. Breyer wrote separately in General Electric Co. v. Joiner to observe that cases presenting science issues have increased significantly and to urge judges to seek help from specialists in trying to understand difficult subjects, perhaps through pretrial hearings, the appointment of special masters or specially trained law clerks. Justice John Paul Stevens joined the rest of the justices in saying appeals courts must give great deference to trial judges, but dissented from the part of the opinion assessing the evidence in Joiner\\'s case. He said the court did not have a sufficient record before it to review the experts\\' methodology and conclusions. John G. Kester, a Washington lawyer who represented General Electric, said the ruling sends a message to lower courts to scrutinize the methodology behind an expert\\'s conclusions and to ensure that studies introduced at trial are relevant. Kenneth J. Chesebro of Boston, who represented Joiner, said it is unlikely to give either manufacturers or people alleging injuries the upper hand. \"\"The range of discretion can go either way . . . to get rid of evidence or keep it in,\"\" he said.

       " '\"To the Inuits of northern Canada, it is the one of the scariest poisons imaginable: an invisible toxin that has infiltrated the cells of arctic creatures from plankton to people and turned ordinary whales into floating hazardous waste dumps. To governments in central Africa, it is a chemical safety net, a primary defense against a worsening malaria epidemic that kills 5,000 children each day in countries south of the equator. On Monday, officials from as many as 120 nations will begin to try to reconcile these starkly contrasting views of DDT, the infamous insecticide long banned in the United States but still widely used in many parts of the developing world. Armed with new evidence about the pesticide\\'s global spread, negotiators will gather in Montreal to start work on an unprecedented United Nations treaty to phase out DDT and 11 other toxic compounds that have been linked to cancers, birth defects and ecological disruption. The 12 chemicals, called \"\"persistent organic pollutants,\"\" also include dioxins, PCBs and other industrial compounds known for their ability to travel long distances and concentrate in animal tissues. Largely unknown before World War II, many substances on the dirty-dozen list are present in trace levels in virtually every person on Earth. Some of the worst cases of contamination are found in the Arctic, where high levels of DDTs, dioxins and PCBs are found in humans and marine creatures thousands of miles from the nearest industrial centers. Levels of the toxins have remained steady for more than a decade, even though production of most of them has been banned in Western countries for a quarter-century. \"\"This is a global problem and therefore requires a global solution,\"\" Rafe Pomerance, the State Department\\'s deputy assistant secretary for the environment, told a recent Washington news conference. \"\"Many of these problems we cannot solve alone. They exist and are created outside our borders.\"\" Governments at the Montreal meeting will frame the proposed accord this week in anticipation of signing the treaty in 2000. But negotiations are complicated by national interests and concerns over other kinds of public health threats -- particularly malaria. The Clinton administration, which strongly supports a ban, is reluctant to be viewed as bullying governments into halting DDT use at a time when malaria deaths are rising. Other countries see the pesticide as a crucial weapon against encephalitis and related insect-borne illnesses with lethal effects that are far more direct. \"\"Our position is we\\'d optimally like to see a phaseout,\"\" said one administration official who will participate in this week\\'s talks. Malaria remains a major health problem in more than 90 countries and kills as many as 2.7 million people each year, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. DDT remains the pesticide of choice for developing countries because it is relatively cheap and is less acutely toxic than many alternatives. The World Health Organization continues to endorse DDT as a \"\"most valuable tool\"\" for controlling malaria, although it also has begun issuing warnings about the spread of pesticide through the food chain. But environmental groups, citing evidence of long-term ecological damage, are calling for an expedited phaseout of all 12 compounds -- along with economic and technical assistance to help developing countries find replacements. The World Wildlife Fund, in a report earlier this year, said persistent organic pollutants pose a particular health threat to whales and dolphins, who typically store large amounts of man-made chemicals in their body fat. The report suggested toxin contamination may have been an indirect cause of several well-publicized die-offs of marine mammals in recent years. \"\"DDT is clearly impacting the environment in some serious ways,\"\" said Cliff Curtis, WWF\\'s global toxics campaign director. \"\"We see alternatives {to DDT} that already exist and possibilities for other solutions in the near term. All that\\'s required is political will.\"\" The 12 chemicals targeted for phaseout were selected because of their wide distribution -- most, like DDT, are commonly found in animals around the world -- and because of a high potential for damage to health and ecosystems. In addition to DDT and PCBs, the list includes the industrial compound hexachlorobenzene, dioxins and furans, and seven pesticides. All are banned for commercial use in the United States. Typically, the chemicals usually enter humans through contaminated foods. Because they are not easily broken down or excreted, the compounds remain in the body for months or years, stored in organs such as the liver, or in fat. In ecosystems, they tend to concentrate or \"\"bioaccumulate\"\" in animals at the top of the food chain, in the bodies of large meat-eaters such as marine mammals, polar bears, raptors and people. At high levels, the chemicals are known to damage the central nervous system and suppress the body\\'s ability to fight off diseases. Many of them are also known endocrine disruptors, which can cause deformities in sex organs as well as long-term disruption of reproductive systems. \"\"A lot of these effects occur at much lower concentrations than it takes to kill the organism,\"\" said Robert Hale, an organic environmental chemist at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science. At his laboratory in the Chesapeake Bay town of Gloucester Point, Hale examines fish and amphibians collected around the country for traces of DDT and PCBs -- and finds them everywhere. \"\"One of the scariest things,\"\" Hale said, \"\"is that we still know so little about them.\"\" Credit: Washington Post Staff Writer\"',\n",
       " '\"In the dim light of her tidy trailer, the widow dabs at her eyes and presents proof that the man she loved for more than four decades -- \"\"my Wally\"\" -- existed. Proof that he was born, worked, sacrificed, lived and died. An ordinary man, but one like no other. His name was Walter S. Kasza, and Stella Kasza wants you to know that, damn it, he existed. He was her man.       She displays his Army papers: He landed in Europe in \\'44, fought in the Ardennes, earned three bronze stars. On the paneled wall hangs their wedding portrait -- St. Norbert\\'s Church in Detroit, 1950 -- and pictures of their children. \"\"You\\'re together that long, you eat together, you sleep together,\"\" Stella says, her voice dissipating to a sigh. More tears, another tissue.        From the pantry she retrieves a brown paper bag full of empty pill vials. For years the doctors couldn\\'t figure out why Wally was coughing so much, why his skin cracked and bled, turning their bedsheets red. They prescribed unguents, antibiotics, decongestants, pain killers. His guts ached for years, too, and when they finally found the kidney cancer, even morphine didn\\'t help the pain. He died in April 1995, a wraith, 73 years old.       \"\"Memories,\"\" she says bitterly, tossing the vials into the bag. \"\"Nobody gives a damn. Nobody.\"\"       Stella Kasza, silver-haired, strong-willed -- \"\"I\\'ve got a temper, a Polish temper,\"\" she warns -- blames all the high and mighty officials back in Washington for what happened to her Wally, and one big shot in particular. \"\"If Clinton was here right now I\\'d look at him and say, `You know what you did to my man? You took my life away. You -- \\' \"\" She spits out several curses.         Bill Clinton certainly did not kill Wally Kasza, but he has been forced to deal with his angry widow. The administration maintains an abiding interest in the lawsuit Stella Kasza has brought against the federal government. Under a \"\"presidential determination\"\" that he must renew annually, Clinton has decreed that potential evidence related to Kasza\\'s death is classified, top-secret, a matter of national security -- and that \"\"it is in the paramount interest of the United States\"\" that none of it be disclosed.         Why should Wally Kasza matter? He was a sheet-metal worker. For seven years he put up buildings and installed cooling systems for a defense contractor at an Air Force base in the middle of the Nevada desert.        But that base, about 100 miles due north of here, is the most mysterious in America. It is so secret that top officials won\\'t say anything about it -- they claim it has no name. They only speak of it in the most general terms: \"\"There is an operating location near Groom Dry Lake.\"\" That\\'s the Air Force\\'s official position.       Stella Kasza and the rest of America know it as Area 51.       In the imagination of UFO enthusiasts, Area 51 is where the government harbors space aliens and conducts experiments on recovered interstellar craft. The real secrets of Area 51 are more mundane. And they involve things more dangerous to human beings than the squidlike aliens in \"\"Independence Day,\"\" a movie that used Area 51\\'s obsessive secrecy as a plot device.        What\\'s being covered up there, according to lawsuits filed by Kasza\\'s widow, another worker\\'s widow and five former Area 51 employees, are brazen environmental crimes. For several years, the workers say, they labored in thick, choking clouds of poisonous smoke as hazardous wastes were burned in huge open trenches on the base. Military officers armed with M-16s stood guard as truckloads of resins, paints and solvents -- materials used to make the Stealth bomber and other classified aircraft -- were doused with jet fuel and set ablaze with road flares.        Another sheet-metal worker at Area 51, Robert Frost, died at age 57, allegedly from exposure to hazardous wastes. Biopsies showed that his tissues were filled with industrial toxins rarely seen in humans. Men who worked there from the late 1970s into the early 1990s say that inhaling the smoke resulted in persistent respiratory distress, cancers and strange rashes.       \"\"Fish scales,\"\" the workers call these hard membranes. Some use sandpaper to remove the embarrassing growths from their hands, feet, legs and arms, but they keep coming back. They slather themselves with Crisco to stop their skin from blistering and cracking.       What is the government\\'s response to these horror stories? The government says . . . nothing. The policy is that nothing illegal occurred at Area 51 because, officially, nothing occurs at Area 51.       Employees there cannot talk about the work they do. Everything and everyone connected to the base is classified -- part of the military\\'s multi-billion-dollar \"\"black budget\"\" operations. \"\"Specific activities . . . both past and present . . . cannot be discussed,\"\" the Air Force says in a statement.         That position infuriates Stella Kasza because it makes her husband disposable, a nonentity. She sees it this way: If, officially, Wally Kasza didn\\'t work at Area 51 for seven years, then, officially, his death had nothing to do with his job. He didn\\'t wake up with bloody pajamas from the fish scales, didn\\'t hack his lungs out in the middle of the night kneeling next to the bed. Didn\\'t get cancer. Didn\\'t suffer so horribly that his son wanted to smother him with a pillow to end it all.         Stella Kasza stanches her tears, points to a table in the living room and says, \"\"There is something he made.\"\" It\\'s a miniature, felt-topped craps table, perfectly detailed; Wally was quite the handyman. Now it holds Stella\\'s legal papers, medical reports, clippings, letters. Thick envelopes full of evidence that she hopes will be enough to prove in federal court that her Wally worked and died for the United States government. Officially.  A Base With No Name       \"\"Someday I hope to visit Stella and not make her cry,\"\" says attorney Jonathan Turley, driving away from his client\\'s triple-wide trailer in the Desert Inn Mobile Estates. It\\'s a sun-blasted retirement community near a blue-collar casino whose billboard advertises \"\"Cash your paycheck -- win up to $250,000!\"\"        Turley is a law professor at George Washington University -- he directs its nonprofit Environmental Law Advocacy Center, funded in part by Hollywood do-gooder Barbra Streisand. He flies here every few months to meet with the clients he is representing in a lawsuit against the government -- Area 51 workers past and present and their families. He represented Wally Kasza before he died.       The brash young lawyer would meet the sick old man in secret, in cars and garages, fearful of detection by military investigators. If Turley seems paranoid -- he avoids using hotel phones, travels under phony names, swears he is being tailed -- he has his reasons.       His campus office remains sealed by federal court order -- students and others are not allowed to enter because the government says Turley\\'s files hold documents that are classified. In a letter, a Justice Department attorney helpfully called Turley\\'s attention to the specific statute that, \"\"as you know, prohibits unauthorized possession of national security information\"\" and provides a mandatory 10 years in prison for violators. (Turley is appealing the order that classified his office.)       The Area 51 workers he represents also face 10 years in the slammer if they are caught disclosing anything about their jobs. In court papers, they are identified only as John Doe. Their affidavits express fear of \"\"retaliation, harassment and injury\"\" if their civilian employers or the military finds out who they are.        \"\"These are deeply patriotic guys,\"\" Turley says of his clients, many of whom have military backgrounds. \"\"They are trained to go with the program and trust the line of command. It took a great deal for them to even talk to an attorney.\"\"         Turley represents more than 25 workers at no charge. He filed the case three years ago against the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Defense. The plaintiffs aren\\'t asking for money; they want information on the chemicals they might have been exposed to so they can get appropriate medical treatment. They also want the military to admit that burning barrels of toxic wastes -- allegedly twice a week for more than a decade -- was wrong.       And they want an apology. \"\"Let them admit the truth,\"\" one worker says.       They\\'ll probably get none of the above. So far, the government\\'s arguments for absolute secrecy have largely been upheld in U.S. District Court here. Unless they win on appeal, the Area 51 workers will face the same fate as the nuclear test site workers, uranium miners and the hapless citizens of Nevada and Utah who were exposed to radiation during the heyday of atomic bomb testing: Many got sick and died, and the courts held no one liable.       \"\"I don\\'t like to be discouraging, but I fought these lawsuits for 15 years and we failed, we failed in all three cases,\"\" says lawyer Stewart L. Udall, who was secretary of the interior during the Kennedy and Johnson administrations. \"\"You have to ask which is more important: grave damage to this vague concept of `national security\\' or grave damage to American democracy?\"\"         Turley had hoped that, when confronted with credible testimony about environmental crimes and evidence of the workers\\' illnesses, the Pentagon might cover their medical bills, or allow them to be treated for free by military doctors with the proper security clearances. He asked the Justice Department to give his clients immunity and launch a criminal investigation. Instead, the Justice Department, the EPA, the Air Force and the White House erected a stony wall of secrecy -- not denying the charges, but not confirming them, either.        A few months after Turley sued, EPA officials conducted their first-ever inspection of Area 51. It was a victory, but a hollow one. Backed by Clinton, the Air Force refuses to disclose the results of the inspection -- meaning the workers can\\'t know what hazardous wastes might have been incinerated there. \"\"President Clinton\\'s decision protects the environment and national security,\"\" the Justice Department intones.        In a statement issued to The Washington Post, the Air Force touts its \"\"strong environmental record,\"\" but spokesmen refuse to address any questions about Area 51. \"\"Most people understand that there is some information the government has to keep secret . . . to protect national security and the military personnel who keep us all safe,\"\" the statement says.        The litigation puts the government in the Orwellian position of trying to keep secret a 40,000-acre complex where airplanes and buses full of workers arrive every day. (Hundreds of them commute from Las Vegas\\'s main airport on 737 jets that bear no external identification numbers.) Not only have Russian satellites photographed the base -- huge blowups are for sale locally -- but it can be observed from a nearby mountain. Locals also call it Dreamland, Watertown, the Ranch, or more generically, the Test Site -- a name that dates from the \\'50s, when you could sip \"\"atomic cocktails\"\" in Vegas while watching mushroom clouds rise over the desert.        \"\"There is no name for the operating location near Groom Lake,\"\" an Air Force attorney named Richard Sarver insisted to federal Judge Philip Pro in 1995, during one of the few public proceedings in the Area 51 lawsuits. Please ignore references to Area 51 in previous cases and in 300 pages of job-related and government documents obtained by Turley, Sarver said. \"\"Your honor, there is no name.\"\"  The Mosaic Theory       The weathered metal sign at the border of Area 51 identifies it in large red letters as a \"\"Restricted Area.\"\" It warns that anyone who trespasses comes under the jurisdiction of military law. You may be buzzed by a helicopter or an F-16. You may be shot.       \"\"Use of Deadly Force Authorized,\"\" the sign says, citing, in smaller print, the \"\"Internal Security Act of 1950.\"\"       In many ways this place is an anachronism, a vestige of the days when unquestioned military authority seemed necessary to keep the world free. At Area 51, a rigid Cold War mentality still prevails: America\\'s enemies are everywhere. Workers tell of an intimidating security apparatus within the base, of wiretaps and gunpoint interrogations.       Established by the CIA in the mid-\\'50s, the base sprawls over a dry lake bed that once served as a landing strip for the U2 spy plane. The reasons for calling it Area 51 are obscure, but declassified manuals cite an equally mysterious Area 27 and Area 12 in the vast federally owned desert.       Solar-powered robotic video cameras observe anyone who approaches Area 51\\'s perimeter; parabolic microphones pick up conversations. There are motion sensors beneath the dusty soil.       \"\"They\\'re watching you now,\"\" Jonathan Turley says, hiking up a ridge about 13 miles from Area 51. He focuses his binoculars on the spindly robot, and scans the ridge for evidence of Jeep-driving security men, known locally as \"\"Cammo Dudes.\"\" None is visible. \"\"They\\'re being shy today,\"\" he says.       Trying to prove a point, Turley has brought us to the base\\'s one public border that can be reached by paved road. When a white-and-silver bus barrels by in a cloud of dust, he is ecstatic. \"\"Did you get a photo?!\"\" he shouts.         Typically, those bus riders would be union laborers -- the Wally Kaszas of Area 51 -- who rise at 3 a.m. for the haul up from Vegas. The bus is evidence that people work at Area 51, of course. But Turley also regularly photographs the buses and planes to document what he calls \"\"activity consistent with hazardous waste storage.\"\" If there are vehicles, there must be batteries and fuel on the base, he argues.        The Air Force refused to admit even that much in its legal briefs. The government\\'s lawyers say that acknowledging the existence of innocuous and essential items would place the nation at grave risk.         The \"\"mosaic theory,\"\" the Air Force calls it. If, say, the Iraqis or North Koreans were to learn about any materials or chemicals used at the Groom Lake base, the argument goes, they could puzzle out how we make secret weapons and radar-defeating planes.        Air Force Secretary Sheila Widnall raises the prospect of spies skulking behind saguaro cactuses, sniffing for smoke, combing the desert around Area 51 for clues. \"\"Collection of information regarding the air, water and soil is a classic foreign intelligence practice,\"\" she states in a 1995 affidavit, \"\"because analysis of these samples can result in the identification of military operations and capabilities.\"\"        The workers say that under the mosaic theory, nothing could leave the base, and that\\'s why everything was burned, from old computers to entire tractor-trailers. Some men had to scramble into the pits after the ashes cooled to ensure complete incineration -- increasing their exposure to toxins, according to the lawsuits.         Environmental crimes are particularly insidious because, as Turley points out, the victims often don\\'t know they are victims. The burnings alleged by the workers are punishable by up to 15 years in prison. From their perspective, the evidence has been suppressed by the most powerful man in America. Federal environmental law requires public disclosure of the results of the EPA\\'s inspection of the Groom Lake base. To prevent this, President Clinton invoked the military and state secrets privilege, specifically exempting the base from disclosing any pollution reports.        \"\"Clinton doesn\\'t want these crimes made public,\"\" says Turley, building up to a full-fledged rant: \"\"When we finally prevail in this case and the truth comes out, I think the public is going to want to burn the Justice Department to the ground -- followed quickly thereafter by the White House.\"\"        Prone to hyperbole and something of a media hound, Turley is the grandson of a former United Mine Workers official who contracted black lung. He likes to quote his grandmother\\'s recollections of how mules were deemed more valuable than people by the coal companies.       Now 36, Turley has been a loyal liberal since his days as a teenage congressional page. He takes on cases that give him high-profile platforms -- he also represents rebellious federal grand jurors who investigated environmental crimes at the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons facility in Colorado and opposed the Justice Department\\'s decision to levy fines rather than send corporate officials to jail.       Turley sees delicious hypocrisies in the Area 51 case. It allows him to target a president who\\'s often touted his environmental record. And who claims to have empathy for working-class citizens done wrong by government experiments. In October 1995, Clinton publicly apologized to victims of secret radiation tests in New Mexico.       \"\"When the government does wrong, we have the moral responsibility to admit it,\"\" the president said. Americans have become cynical and lost faith in democracy, he said, \"\"because of stonewallings and evasions of the past, times when a family member or a neighbor suffered an injustice and had nowhere to turn and couldn\\'t even get the facts.\"\"        A few days before that speech, Clinton signed the first order exempting Area 51 from disclosing its pollution records.  John Doe in Secret       Sitting in a seedy motel room near the Vegas Strip, his back to the window, the man offers a handshake and introduces himself. \"\"John Doe,\"\" he says in a phlegmy voice.       He proceeds with his story of how 55-gallon drums of classified chemicals were trucked in from a California aircraft facility and routinely set ablaze at Area 51.        \"\"The barrels would blow up and vaporize, like a huge smoke grenade. The smoke was dark, grayish white -- it was as thick as London fog.\"\" He hacks, wheezes and clears his throat.       \"\"When I went up there I was in good health -- healthy as an ox,\"\" the man says. He\\'s never smoked, he says, and coughs again. \"\"I\\'d like to know if there\\'s a remedy to reestablish my breathing -- or will I be like this the rest of my life? Has my life expectancy been shortened?\"\"        As a condition of conducting the interview, Turley says we can\\'t describe the man or his work in any way. The lawyer believes the Air Force\\'s Office of Special Investigations (OSI) is trying to photograph or otherwise hunt down the \"\"John Does,\"\" to bring charges against them for breaching national security.       Turley paces nervously, drawing aside the curtains on the room\\'s only window, checking the peephole at the door. He turns up the television -- a precaution, he says, against electronic eavesdropping.       \"\"I\\'m sure the room\\'s clean but that window bothers me,\"\" he says. Laser microphones can pick up conversations from vibrations on glass, even from the ice in a drink. Turley keeps up on spook technology. He once did a stint in the general counsel\\'s office of the National Security Agency.       He instructs John Doe to take a seat farther from the window.       The man goes on: How workers were denied breathing masks; how he was told to quit if he didn\\'t like it.       But the money was good -- at least $15,000 above the annual wages in Vegas. You just had to get used to a climate of fear. If you were ordered not to look up at some crazy new plane overhead, you kept your eyes on the dirt.       \"\"It was very understood that when you left there, you never talked about this. You can\\'t divulge anything, not even its existence. How can a guy go and make a claim for workman\\'s comp if the investigator can\\'t investigate what it was?\"\"        Suddenly, Turley is pushing aside the curtains. Trouble. \"\"A van just pulled up next to the window,\"\" he announces. \"\"Three guys, clean-cut, are getting out.\"\"        He terminates the interview. \"\"We stayed too long.\"\"        The van\\'s passengers have put its hood up. To Turley that\\'s a classic sign of surveillance: the old car-trouble ruse.        The lawyer picked this motel because guests must park in a central courtyard. The room\\'s window faces a rarely used road. What is that van doing there?         A reporter and photographer drive around the side of the building to case the van. The men are gone. It\\'s a dark blue Dodge, a bit beat up. Its license plate reads . . .        U.S. Air Force. For Official Use Only.  The Official Response       It was all a coincidence, an Air Force spokesman at the Pentagon says later. Yes, the Office of Special Investigations routinely probes national security leaks, but that wasn\\'t an OSI detachment, he assures us.       The Air Force traced the license number of the blue van. It turns out that the men came from a C-141 transport plane and were overnighting in Las Vegas because of a bunk shortage at nearby Nellis Air Force Base.       Can we have the van\\'s maintenance records, to see if it really had a breakdown?       Sorry, the spokesman says. That information is confidential.  John Doe in Tears       Another hotel room, another John Doe. This one is weeping at the memory of his co-workers. \"\"I\\'m sorry I get so emotional,\"\" he says. \"\"It\\'s hell to watch someone die.\"\"       He may be next. Ugly, crusty scales cover part of his body.       How easily the tears come in this arid place. But how quickly they dry -- as if they never existed.  Love Everlasting      All of this started because of $300. About 10 years ago, Robert Frost, who was foreman of the sheet-metal workers at Area 51, became so ill that he missed a week of work. By then his face and body were scarred by scales and red welts. He would drape himself in a blanket to shield his skin from the sun. His legs buckled when he tried to walk.        Frost filed a claim for lost wages; his employer, Reynolds Electrical & Engineering Co., fought it. By the time a hearing was held in 1990, Frost was dead of a liver disease that doctors associated with exposure to smoke containing dioxin and dibenzofurans, chemicals found in plastics and solvents. But the compensation claim was denied after a company superintendent testified that no burning ever occurred at Area 51.       Frost\\'s widow, Helen, got a belt buckle in the mail -- \"\"in appreciation of Robert\\'s 10 years of continuous service with REECo,\"\" the accompanying letter said. \"\"We deeply regret that the award cannot be presented to him.\"\"       Furious, she wanted to file a wrongful death claim, but the lawyers in Las Vegas told her there was nothing to be done -- the military and its contractors were too powerful.       Eventually Helen Frost found a Washington watchdog group, the Project on Government Oversight, that was willing to investigate. She knew of several other widows and workers. One of them was her husband\\'s good friend Wally Kasza -- a guy so tough he worked up at Area 51 until he was 69, when he became too sick to go on.       Wally and \"\"Frostie,\"\" as friends knew him, were union brothers in Local 88. Now their widows are united in their scorn for the federal government, lending their names to the lawsuits Frost v. Perry (against the former secretary of defense) and Kasza v. Browner (against the EPA administrator).       Turley, who took over the case from the oversight group, is like a son to them. When he comes to call, they have cookies and pies waiting, and the latest proud stories about their grandchildren.       They are a lot alike, Stella and Helen. They grew up in ethnic Rust Belt towns, met and married their men as teenagers -- they never thought they\\'d lose them. Their men had fought wars, come home to tell about it. How could the government they fought for betray them, put them in mortal danger without fair warning? How could everyone right up to the president deny it?        Keeping secrets is one thing, the black-budget widows say. But people still ought to count for something. The truth ought to count.       Stella Kasza points to the wall. An Olan Mills studio portrait taken several years ago captures her loving gaze as she poses next to a still-handsome old devil with wavy gray hair, the guy whose big grin and blue eyes first made her swoon when she was 15, when he lived down the block.       A sappy country song is playing on the radio. Stella turns it up, up, up -- as loud as she can stand it. Something about having one last night together on the town. She sways across the room, alone, trying not to cry again. PHOTO,,Bill O\\'leary CAPTION: It\\'s out there: Attorney Jonathan Turley squints into the sun toward Area 51, 13 miles away.

       " '\"The Food and Drug Administration warned yesterday that at least three people have died and more than 100 have become ill after taking unregulated new products marketed as health supplements promoting such results as bigger muscles, sounder sleep and better sex. The FDA issued the warning about products containing a substance known as BD, whose dual qualities as stimulant and sedative have given it growing appeal as a party drug. The warning underscored how current laws make it difficult to police a booming dietary supplements industry offering a burgeoning menu of largely unregulated products, often sold by obscure companies over the Internet. Yesterday\\'s alert came only months after the FDA issued a similar warning about a very similar drug that has the same effects. Products containing BD, which stands for 1,4 butanediol, are sold under a variety of brand names, including Revitalize Plus, Serenity, Enliven, GHRE, SomatoPro, NRG3, Thunder Nectar and Weight Belt Cleaner, the FDA said. Labels may also list tetramethylene glycol, gamma butyrolactone or 2(3H)-Furanone di-hydro as active ingredients. Although specific sales figures were not available, a distributor for SomatoPro said the company probably sold \"\"more than 300 bottles\"\" per week, with 180 capsules per bottle. In Pennsylvania, Internet marketer Maria Gomez said SomatoPro was a \"\"very popular item\"\" on her Web site. Clients reported \"\"extra energy, that it helped for sleep, was good after back surgeries for pain control.\"\" She said she sold about 12 bottles per week at $65 per bottle. The FDA is investigating, and \"\"once we identify the manufacturers, we will seek to stop the distributions,\"\" said John Taylor, the agency\\'s senior adviser for regulatory policy. The agency has documented deaths caused by BD in Florida, Texas and Connecticut, and is studying other cases in which the drug may have been involved. In Texas, state Health Commissioner William R. Archer III reported last week that an Austin man died after he and his wife took Thunder Nectar. The woman was unconscious for several hours but survived, the state Health Department said in a statement. In all, the FDA said, BD and related chemicals have resulted in 122 reports of adverse effects, including dangerously low heartbeat and breathing rates, vomiting, seizures, unconsciousness and coma. Taylor explained that once BD is swallowed as a pill or liquid, the body converts it into gamma hydroxybutyrate, also known as GHB, a substance described by the FDA as \"\"a very potent, unapproved drug\"\" being studied as a possible cure for narcolepsy. The FDA banned GHB in 1991, but a law approved by Congress in 1994 sharply reduced the FDA\\'s ability to regulate substances marketed as \"\"dietary supplements\"\" even though, like BD, they may be \"\"precursors\"\" to dangerous drugs. \"\"There is no registration requirement,\"\" said Bruce Silverglade, director of legal affairs for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a Washington-based consumer group. \"\"Before 1994, the FDA demanded that the manufacturers provide evidence that the product was safe. Now the burden is on the FDA to prove that it\\'s dangerous.\"\" GHB and its precursors became popular as recreational drugs because they activate two two different types of nerve cells: some that have a stimulating effect and others that sedate the central nervous system. Weightlifters and wrestlers have used the drugs for bodybuilding and weight loss. They are also used to induce sleep and as an aphrodisiac, and have been implicated in cases of \"\"date rape.\"\" In 1998, authorities arrested and imprisoned a California chiropractor for distributing BD at a New Year\\'s Eve party where more than 100 guests became ill. In January of this year, the FDA issued a warning for gamma butyrolactone (GBL), another GHB precursor linked to one death and 54 cases of serious illness. Three companies agreed to recall their supplements, while four others refused. Cases against them are pending, Taylor said. Taylor said the crackdown on GBL -- used primarily in nail polish remover, floor stripper and other solvents -- is probably what caused the manufacturers to shift to BD as a way of getting around the warning. John Cardellina, vice president for botanical science and regulatory affairs for 100 supplement manufacturers in the Council for Responsible Nutrition, blamed \"\"Internet rogues\"\" who took advantage of the FDA\\'s inability to monitor every Web site that markets the drugs. \"\"We\\'re not happy about this,\"\" said Cardellina, who acknowledged that such incidents taint the entire dietary supplement industry. \"\"These are small, high-risk entrepreneurs who will take chance of marketing {the drugs} on the Internet in the very short term and then disappear.\"\" Credit: Washington Post Staff Writer\"']"
